# RTSP-protocol-implementation-server

The Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is a network control protocol designed for use in entertainment and communications systems to control streaming media servers. The protocol is used for establishing and controlling media sessions between end points. Clients of media servers issue VCR-style commands, such as play, record and pause, to facilitate real-time control of the media streaming from the server to a client (Video On Demand) or from a client to the server (Voice Recording).

In this implementation a client and a server has been implemented. A video file has been stroed in the server side for streaming during demonstration.

Also the xml encoding has been implemented in the implementation so that the request and response message can be read in wireshark/tcpdump.

In this part the server part code is available. To see the Client part code please go the other repo named tanzeemzillu/RTSP-protocol-implementation-client
